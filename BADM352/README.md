HOSPITAL DATABASE PROJECT

The purpose of this project was to use what we have learned in class to create and implement a database of our choosing. This project was a collaboration between myself and 2 other members. The top comment has been redacted for privacy purposes. 

When executed, this script will create the tables, upload sample data, and perform some sample queries to make sure the database is working correctly.
